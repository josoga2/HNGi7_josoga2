## HNGi 7 First Task


Ever wanted to manage your digital products in an intelligent, collaborative and secure space, then you probably need GitHub. **GitHub** is a Git based version control software (VCS) which has grown into one of the most important tools for developers globally.

However, without a proper briefing system (or way of summarizing), the collaborative power of GitHub is lost. Developers globally have adopted the README file (which github tells you to create upon creation of a new repo) as a standard convention for documenting summaries, install guides, versioning, tech stack, snapshots, images, licensing and collaborators. This is effectively done using a simple syntax known as Markdown abbreviated as .md, hence the file Readme.md.

In this post, I will show you how to use markdown syntax. Calm down, it is very intuitive. 

Headings (The more the Hash, the lower the font size)
# Heading 1
## Heading 2
### Heading 3
Making Emphasis (this looks like WhatsApp text editing)
_Italicize with underscore_
**Make bold with double asterics**
~~Strikethrough with tildes~~
List (very simple)
- Use hyphens
Insert hyperlinks (That redirects to another page)
[Google](https://www.google.com)
Image (the images have to be within the same github repo, e.g. A snapshot of you app)

Code (Maybe a few codes to set up environment)

A `code` can be inside a line
``` #An entire line can be a code as well```
```python3 josoga2.py```

Blockquotes (github's version of reply email)
> You are doing well !!!
Tables (A little bit technical, but intuitive)

| Tables        | Are           | Cool  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| col 3 is      | right-aligned | $1600 |
| col 2 is      | centered      |   $12 |
| zebra stripes | are neat      |    $1 |

These are the basics of markdown with Github, and I hope they should get you going.
